TO DO

Check out twine and how to make it work with incremental part

Create basic fantasy setting where spirit is generated - use agriculture, trading, military

alloys, lumber, mushrooms
grow metals (???)
tin


generate crops
use crops to feed people - grow pops
town has limited space

agriculture - using gains for own development
trading - using gains for social development
military - using gains for dominance

crops grow
randomly, a rare crop will grow (TIN, copper)
use rare crops for varying purposes (???) affect rate of rare crops?

while procedural == true:  
    



PLAN 

Objective : Increase spirit

In beginning -- harvest crops (might tie a cooldown to it later)

When crop threshold is reached, unlock multiple opportunities for refinement

Gain a pop -- each pop provides spirit


agricultural: -- produces food
    Upgrades:
    clicking power upgraded by number of farmers
    harvest power increase
    harvesting also generates spirit

trade:  -- generates constant spirit -- exchange resources (bad to begin with)
    Each trader generates an additional spirit
    Offers randomised trades from neibouring factions (maybe work this out with milo)
    3 choices, and a refresh button.

    More traders, less cooldown

    Upgrades -- cost Grivna:
    Better offers upfront
    More spirit yields from trades
    Random haggle chance
    automatic *best* trade
    Merchants procure a random resource every tick

military:  -- risk/reward for much spirit -- capture food / ore 
    Upgrades:
        Reduce risk
        Raise reward
        Increase rate



To do -- Again
List Warfare Stats -- and show Upgrades
Create Trade screen
write milo a script


Todo

Show and hide upgrades DONE
add cooldown to trade -- and make spirit gain dependent on value -- also randomise trade values
    TRADE
    
Make new upgrades -- later make the upgrades generic

Better Trade cooldown
Harvest based on number of Farmers
Gain Trophies from warfare (these generate spirit)


Add trophies as the output of military -- generate spirit per tick
finish war things -- rewards are janky

Todo
Make trophies gen spirit per tick (1)
Add Warfare upgrades, Agriculture upgrades
Add descriptions
Make a social Media post (BOOOO) [DONE]
Have lunch :))) << - DOing this one

Todo
Make some breakfast
Chill until 9am

Fuse metals (onetime) - cost tin
Increase farmer power - cost copper
Add farmer power to click power  - cost crops
Gain spirit when you gain crops - cost bronze

Increase reward multiplier - cost trophies
Increase reward chance - cost copper
Reduce Risk - cost tin

Add trophies, bronze to trade warTable
Make upgrades show in descriptions
