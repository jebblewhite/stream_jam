TO DO

Check out twine and how to make it work with incremental part

Create basic fantasy setting where spirit is generated - use agriculture, trading, military

alloys, lumber, mushrooms
grow metals (???)
tin


generate crops
use crops to feed people - grow pops
town has limited space

agriculture - using gains for own development
trading - using gains for social development
military - using gains for dominance

crops grow
randomly, a rare crop will grow (TIN, copper)
use rare crops for varying purposes (???) affect rate of rare crops?

while procedural == true:  
    



PLAN 

Objective : Increase spirit

In beginning -- harvest crops (might tie a cooldown to it later)

When crop threshold is reached, unlock multiple opportunities for refinement

Gain a pop -- each pop provides spirit


agricultural: -- produces food
    Upgrades:
    clicking power upgraded by number of farmers
    harvest power increase
    harvesting also generates spirit

trade:  -- generates constant spirit -- exchange resources (bad to begin with)
    Each trader generates an additional spirit
    Offers randomised trades from neibouring factions (maybe work this out with milo)
    3 choices, and a refresh button.

    More traders, less cooldown

    Upgrades -- cost Grivna:
    Better offers upfront
    More spirit yields from trades
    Random haggle chance
    automatic *best* trade
    Merchants procure a random resource every tick

military:  -- risk/reward for much spirit -- capture food / ore 
    Upgrades:
        Reduce risk
        Raise reward
        Increase rate



To do -- Again
List Warfare Stats -- and show Upgrades
Create Trade screen
write milo a script


Todo

Show and hide upgrades DONE
add cooldown to trade -- and make spirit gain dependent on value -- also randomise trade values
    TRADE
    
Make new upgrades -- later make the upgrades generic

Better Trade cooldown
Harvest based on number of Farmers
Gain Trophies from warfare (these generate spirit)


Add trophies as the output of military -- generate spirit per tick
finish war things -- rewards are janky

Todo
Make trophies gen spirit per tick (1)
Add Warfare upgrades, Agriculture upgrades
Add descriptions
Make a social Media post (BOOOO) [DONE]
Have lunch :))) << - DOing this one

Todo
Make some breakfast
Chill until 9am

Fuse metals (onetime) - cost tin
Increase farmer power - cost copper
Add farmer power to click power  - cost crops
Gain spirit when you gain crops - cost bronze

Increase reward multiplier - cost trophies
Increase reward chance - cost copper
Reduce Risk - cost tin

Add trophies, bronze to trade warTable
Make upgrades show in descriptions

MILO'S QUESTIONS/POINTS FOR THE SON OF JAS.
    XI couldn't find the function in the Twine that calculates the 'focus' (military, agriculture, commerce) for if2.  So I've just made a variable called $Focus, which can have values "Military", "Commerce", or "Agriculture".  Actually assigning the variable I leave to you.
    XThe final 'work' section about cancelling roleplaying is essential, and answering it should probably be the end condition for 3.  Maybe after timer runs out all other elements but that question disappear, if it hasn't already been slected?
    XCheck my comment at in 'if4' in Twine.
    XJust found a place where I used $Focus in section 4.  Is that an issue?  Especially since it won't have changed since 2?  If problem, really inconsequential part, can easily cut.
    XI've put 2 and 4 into Twine.

TODO
X sec3 Outcome of events function do thing 
X why is the log container being weird 
X WHY CAPITAL LETTER 
FIX COOLDOWN WAR BUG 

X"""If high spirit 
less positive, more negative 

if low spirit 
more positive, less negative

Milo's extra variables:
    insubordination (created in if61m, called in if62m)
    usb (created in if63m, called in)
    $mentalBreak (set to 1 at end of if65m) -- will just do this in the progress number (starts at )
